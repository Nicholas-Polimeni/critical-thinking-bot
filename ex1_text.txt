> In 2019, I waited for hours in the Tokyo heat, in a crowd of thousands, for a glimpse of royalty. The crowd snapped photos and waved flags as Naruhito stood high above us, behind glass in his first public appearance as Japan’s emperor. He waved. I think he also smiled. Sweat dripped down my neck.

> It was all a bit underwhelming, much like [the imperial family’s first social media account, on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/kunaicho_jp), which went public last week. It is, expectedly, a bore: No selfies or phone snaps here, few flickers of personality.

> It’s not surprising that [a 2019 poll](https://www.nhk.or.jp/bunken/research/yoron/pdf/20200301_9.pdf)  [found](https://www.nippon.com/en/in-depth/d00912/) that a bit more than half of 18-to-29-year-olds in Japan have little or no interest in the imperial household. Even creating an Instagram account seems like an acknowledgment by the monarchy that it’s straining to connect with its people and fighting for relevance in a shifting world.

> But if you look hard enough at the page, there are glimpses through the veil: The royals stand before bonsai trees and seem to smile. They kneel in front of earthquake survivors — a symbolic gesture with [decades of precedent](https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20181219/p2a/00m/0na/002000c). The institution has never been much for outsize personalities, so this may be all we get. But it is progress.

> The Imperial Household Agency, the family’s keeper, has tightly controlled its image for decades. In 1990 a photographer caught an informal, if not endearing, moment at a royal wedding: The bride smiled as she brushed aside the hair of the groom. That was too much. The agency [reportedly](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1990/07/03/in-japan-photo-of-newlyweds-angers-officials/8ea4ffc7-631e-46a8-abf3-81717a32678f/) reprimanded the offending photographer.

> Does the Instagram page signal a real loosening up of this old institution? Probably not. But seven years ago, Naruhito, then the crown prince, [promised change](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/world/asia/japan-emperor-abdicates-akihito-naruhito.html), which seems possible as the first emperor to study abroad. (He spent two years at Oxford and has said he loved the experience.) His father, Akihito, [redefined](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/world/asia/japan-emperor-abdicates-akihito-naruhito.html) the role over three decades of rule; perhaps Naruhito can do the same.

> I am a little doubtful that the monarchy can reach a younger crowd. The family appears too buttoned up on Instagram, much like the institution itself. Still, in a little more than a week, the page has gotten almost a million followers. Perhaps this is a turning point, when the institution begins to transform its image, drawing in a new, younger swath of people.
