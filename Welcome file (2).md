# Article Text
*This article was taken from The New York Times on April 11.
> When picking an article to analyze using AI, try to pick one that will benefit from critical analysis, like one talking about political issues, controversial topics, or making extreme statements.
In this case, the article is commenting on Japan's approach to making their royalty relevant to younger generations, which falls under the general category of cultural commentary.*

> In 2019, I waited for hours in the Tokyo heat, in a crowd of thousands, for a glimpse of royalty. The crowd snapped photos and waved flags as Naruhito stood high above us, behind glass in his first public appearance as Japan’s emperor. He waved. I think he also smiled. Sweat dripped down my neck.

> It was all a bit underwhelming, much like [the imperial family’s first social media account, on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/kunaicho_jp), which went public last week. It is, expectedly, a bore: No selfies or phone snaps here, few flickers of personality.

> It’s not surprising that [a 2019 poll](https://www.nhk.or.jp/bunken/research/yoron/pdf/20200301_9.pdf)  [found](https://www.nippon.com/en/in-depth/d00912/) that a bit more than half of 18-to-29-year-olds in Japan have little or no interest in the imperial household. Even creating an Instagram account seems like an acknowledgment by the monarchy that it’s straining to connect with its people and fighting for relevance in a shifting world.

> But if you look hard enough at the page, there are glimpses through the veil: The royals stand before bonsai trees and seem to smile. They kneel in front of earthquake survivors — a symbolic gesture with [decades of precedent](https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20181219/p2a/00m/0na/002000c). The institution has never been much for outsize personalities, so this may be all we get. But it is progress.

> The Imperial Household Agency, the family’s keeper, has tightly controlled its image for decades. In 1990 a photographer caught an informal, if not endearing, moment at a royal wedding: The bride smiled as she brushed aside the hair of the groom. That was too much. The agency [reportedly](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1990/07/03/in-japan-photo-of-newlyweds-angers-officials/8ea4ffc7-631e-46a8-abf3-81717a32678f/) reprimanded the offending photographer.

> Does the Instagram page signal a real loosening up of this old institution? Probably not. But seven years ago, Naruhito, then the crown prince, [promised change](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/world/asia/japan-emperor-abdicates-akihito-naruhito.html), which seems possible as the first emperor to study abroad. (He spent two years at Oxford and has said he loved the experience.) His father, Akihito, [redefined](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/world/asia/japan-emperor-abdicates-akihito-naruhito.html) the role over three decades of rule; perhaps Naruhito can do the same.

> I am a little doubtful that the monarchy can reach a younger crowd. The family appears too buttoned up on Instagram, much like the institution itself. Still, in a little more than a week, the page has gotten almost a million followers. Perhaps this is a turning point, when the institution begins to transform its image, drawing in a new, younger swath of people.

  
# AI Analysis of Article

*To get this AI analysis, I entered the article's text in the Critical Thinking Bot's text input box. All that is needed at this stage is the raw text of the article, which can just be copied and pasted.
The following text is what the AI output. The AI has instructions to divide its commentary into four sections, which you can see below. These sections help users facilitate their own critical thinking through summarization, questions, and counterarguments.*

Key Points Summary:

-   The author attended the first public appearance of Japan's new Emperor Naruhito in 2019 and found it underwhelming.
    
-   The imperial family recently launched an Instagram account to try connecting with younger generations, but it remains rather stiff and formal.
    
-   The monarchy is struggling with relevance as interest declines among young people. The Instagram launch acknowledges this challenge.
    

Critical Thinking Questions:

1.  To what extent can social media truly help modernize a centuries-old institution like the Japanese monarchy? What are the limitations of this approach?
    
2.  How might the monarchy balance tradition with appealing to younger audiences? What compromises or changes could help them connect without losing their core identity?
    
3.  What factors have contributed to declining interest among young people? How might the monarchy address the underlying causes rather than just the symptoms?
    

Insights and Analysis:  
The monarchy faces a dilemma common to many traditional institutions - how to stay true to history and customs while adapting to a rapidly changing society. The Instagram launch is a cautious first step, but unlikely to substantially reshape perceptions on its own. Deeper reforms may be needed to make the family seem more relatable and address why relevance is waning. Younger generations value openness and authenticity, which clashes with the monarchy's strict formality. Incremental loosening of controls could help, but fundamental issues like purpose and role in modern Japan also merit discussion. Overall this highlights tensions between tradition and modernization that many establishments will continue grappling with.

Potential Counterarguments:

-   The monarchy's purpose is symbolic rather than popular - maintaining traditions and national identity may matter more than public opinion polls.
    
-   Too much change could undermine the monarchy's prestige by making it seem common or political. Gradual evolution, not radical reforms, best preserve the institution.
    
-   Declining interest may simply reflect cultural shifts rather than problems with the monarchy itself. Young people prioritize different things in a globalized, digital era.
    

# Human analysis
*AI can't be perfect, which is why deeper analysis is important when thinking critically. AI is a great tool to use, but only when it's coupled with human evaluation as well.
In this case, my analysis is focused on what the AI did not capture in its critical thinking analysis, which included the context in which the article was written, the point of view of the author, and the implicit statements the author was making about traditional Japanese culture.*

The AI captures the key points of the article, but it doesn’t analyze the article on a deeper level. The AI is correct that the author comments on how creating an Instagram account can mean that the Japanese royal family is trying to bridge the gap between its current audience and the young people of Japan, but it missed key concepts to consider when analyzing this article.


For example, the article points out the concept of tension between tradition and modernization in Japan. This is certainly true, but what’s also important is to analyze this article from a more distant viewpoint. The New York Times is an American newspaper, so it might be worth asking why this story was written and published, versus another story about Japan that might paint the country in a different light. Other things that the AI didn’t point out is that the genre of this piece is an opinion piece, meaning the author was not required to strictly adhere to facts. This opinion piece is filtered through the lens of the author’s experience as an American citizen. Instagram is also an American company. The author of the article implied that the Japanese youth are more Americanized than their older counterparts, but he equated Americanization to modernization. The author frames this Americanization as progress, which some people may not agree with.
