> Blame the liberal media.

> It’s been a regular Republican talking point for over 40 years, ever since Vice President Spiro Agnew’s criticism of the media as the “Nattering Nabobs of Negativism”. Now it’s Donald Trump’s main message.

> Trump has recently attacked the mainstream media as being unfair, dishonest, disgusting, corrupt and crooked in its coverage of him. He has referred to them as the lowest form of life, to the delight of his cheering crowds. Many people in the crowd now boo the members of the press during Trump’s events and chant “Lock Them Up”. In the past year, Trump has blacklisted and revoked press credentials for many media outlets, including the Washington Post, Huffington Post, BuzzFeed, Des Moines Register, Univision and Politico.

> It’s ironic that Trump is bashing the media, in that it was the positive and ubiquitous media coverage that helped him dominate the Republican primary field. Trump is now biting the hand that fed him ever since he went down the Trump Tower escalator last year to announce his candidacy. During the primaries, most of the media coverage of Trump was positive. They pretty much ignored the other 16 Republican candidates and let Trump suck all of the oxygen out of the room. The provocative, entertaining and controversial Trump was great for TV ratings. How many Rick Perry, Rick Santorum, or Lindsay Graham campaign events and speeches were televised?

> Now that the primaries are over, the media still gives Trump extensive coverage, but it has subjected him to intense scrutiny about his record that did not occur during the primaries.

> As I note in my new book, Skewed: A Critical Thinker’s Guide to Media Bias, the Republicans’ complaints about liberal media bias are overblown and over exaggerated. Reporters are trained to be fair and balanced (not the Fox News kind), impartial, neutral and detached. The Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) Code of Ethics emphasizes that reporters should seek the truth, be accurate, and keep their independence. While there is no such thing as total objectivity, in that every reporter has their own values and opinions, most reporters do strive for objectivity, fairness, impartiality, and balance. The mainstream media acts as a watchdog for corruption and scandal regarding both Democrats and Republicans and for the most part they do a good job of it. Sure they make mistakes, but they serve a vital public service. Reporters see their work as a noble and important profession and take their jobs seriously as far as being fair and accurate.

> Republicans often repeat the “liberal bias” mantra any time they are posed with tough questions or negative coverage. It’s a way of “working the refs” to try to get positive coverage.

> Reporters and debate moderators do not shy away from controversies involving Democratic and Liberal politicians. They cover Liberal scandals as well as Conservative scandals. For example, during this year’s Democratic debates, Hillary Clinton was asked whether she could be trusted, whether she lied to the Benghazi victims’ families, whether she would drop out of the race if she was indicted about the email scandal, and whether she would release the transcripts of her Wall Street speeches. Bernie Sanders was asked about his past praise of Fidel Castro and how any kind of socialist could win a general election in the United States. The New York Times and other major newspapers have subjected Hillary Clinton to tough scrutiny over the years. Most recently, the mainstream media has criticized her for not holding press conferences. As noted in my book, there are many other examples of tough media coverage of Liberal and Democrats, such as the coverage of President Clinton’s marital infidelity and President Obama’s connections to Rev. Jeremiah Wright.

> In order to demonstrate the concept of Advocacy Journalism, I have my Journalism students watch one Fox News Show, such as Sean Hannity, one MSNBC show, such as Rachel Maddow, and one episode of the Nightly News on NBC, ABC, and CBS. The students’ general consensus is that the Fox News shows have a conservative bias, the MSNBC shows have a liberal bias, and the network nightly news is primarily objective, fair, balanced, impartial and neutral. Unlike the cable news shows, the network nightly news presents both sides of the issues in an even handed manner and the host has a neutral, non-judgmental tone. In contrast, Advocacy Journalism outlets, both Liberal and Conservative, report the news in an opinionated and adversarial manner. This occurs on Fox News, MSNBC, talk radio, which is mostly Republican and Conservative, as well as various Liberal and Conservative websites, blogs, and You Tube and Internet Radio programs.

> If you compare these Advocacy Journalism outlets to the mainstream media, you’ll see that the mainstream media is much more objective, fair, balanced and impartial than the reputation that Donald Trump and Republican Conservatives portray. There is no such thing as perfect objectivity, but most reporters do a good job of being fair and impartial. In this respect, their fairness trumps their negative reputation.

# AI Analysis of Article
*To get this AI analysis, I entered the article's text in the Critical Thinking Bot's text input box.*

Key Points Summary:

- The author argues that claims of liberal media bias by Republicans are overblown and exaggerated. While no media is perfectly objective, mainstream media generally strives for fairness and balance in their reporting.
- Examples are given of tough scrutiny and questioning directed at both Democratic and Republican politicians by the mainstream media.
- A comparison of Fox News, MSNBC, and network nightly news shows found the latter to be more objective and balanced in presenting both sides, while the cable news channels showed more bias.

Critical Thinking Questions:

1. How could we better evaluate claims of media bias - what specific metrics or studies could provide more objective evidence?
2. What factors might unconsciously influence reporters and producers, even if they aim for objectivity? How could media organizations address these?
3. Does focusing criticism mainly on "bias" distract from substantive debates, or is it a valid concern? When does bias-claiming become a political tactic vs a good-faith critique?

Insights and Analysis: The author makes a nuanced argument that acknowledges the ideal of perfect objectivity is impossible, yet mainstream media still aims for fairness through established journalistic standards. By comparing different media formats, they demonstrate advocacy outlets show more open bias while network news maintains balance. However, bias is a complex issue, and unconscious factors could still influence reporting despite good intentions. A broader evaluation of bias claims and the media's role in political discourse could yield further insights.

Potential Counterarguments:

- Claims of bias are still valid even if not "overblown", as small biases can influence perceptions and debates over time.
- Commercial incentives of ratings/clicks may unconsciously pull coverage in a more sensational direction over time, impacting fairness.
- Individual examples don't prove overall trends - a systematic study of issues/tones over long periods could reveal harder-to-see biases.- 

# Human Analysis

*AI can't be perfect, which is why deeper analysis is important when thinking critically. AI is a great tool to use, but only when it's coupled with human evaluation as well.*

Human analysis is necessary because it adds essential depth to the AI analysis of articles. It provides a deeper understanding, capturing context, tone, and emotional subtleties that AI may overlook. Humans can also make ethical judgments and apply complex reasoning that AI can sometimes lack. This combined approach ensures thoroughness, enhances interpretative accuracy, and maintains ethical standards in content analysis, making it indispensable especially in fields like journalism, research, and legal review.

The AI analysis provides a structured and insightful examination of the article. It effectively summarizes key points and raises relevant critical thinking questions which encourage deeper evaluation of media bias. The analysis balances summarization with critical assessment, suggesting that while mainstream media strives for fairness, bias remains a complex, multi-dimensional issue.

However, the analysis could further emphasize the need for empirical evidence in substantiating claims of bias. Additionally, discussing the psychological and economic drivers that might influence media content, such as confirmation bias or advertising pressures, would enhance the depth of the critique. While the AI highlights differences between types of media outlets, a more thorough examination of how these biases manifest in daily reporting could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the issue.
